YOU ACCUSE ROMAN ADLER OF COVERING UP A CRIME;
;
Your theory: Roman knew about Elias's insurance fraud scheme from the beginning. As the host, he had access to everything - he disabled the security cameras, destroyed evidence, and orchestrated the coverup. | The disabled cameras point to an inside job. The meticulous planning. His investment banker precision in eliminating traces. He's protecting himself - and possibly all of them.;
;
You present your case to the district attorney.;

SIX WEEKS LATER;
;
Roman Adler's lake house is searched. Forensics find burned documents in the fireplace - including a handwritten insurance fraud agreement signed by Elias. Traces of Elias's blood on fabric Roman tried to destroy.;
;
Roman confesses to obstruction of justice and accessory after the fact. | He knew about the insurance fraud plot. Elias asked him to "clean up" evidence if things went wrong. When Elias vanished, Roman destroyed documents, disabled cameras, and concealed evidence.;
But he swears he doesn't know where Elias is. | Convicted of obstruction of justice and evidence tampering.;
;
Roman sentenced to 5 years in federal prison and disbarred from investment banking.;

CASE CLOSED | Status: PARTIALLY SOLVED | Grade: B- | Justice: Partial;
;
Roman's career is destroyed. His reputation in ruins. | But Elias remains missing. Did Roman help him escape? Did something worse happen? | The coverup is exposed, but the truth about Elias Moore stays buried. Some questions will never be answered.;
