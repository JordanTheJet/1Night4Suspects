Harper:Around... I don't know, maybe 9:30? We had dinner, things got tense, people scattered. I went to my room.;
Detective:Walk me through your evening. Start from when you arrived.;
Harper:We got there around 7. Rowan made dinner—something fancy, trying too hard. We drank wine, talked about old times. Then... Marcus brought up the company. Elias got defensive.;
Detective:The company Elias sold?;

Harper:StreamMetrics. Yeah. Marcus never forgave him. Can you blame him? Elias made millions while Marcus got... what, two hundred thousand? It was theft, really.;
Detective:What happened after the argument?;
Harper:Marcus left the table. I think he went outside. I... I went to my room. I needed to be alone.;
Detective:You said you went to your room around 9:30. Did you stay there?;
Harper:Yes. Well... I came out around midnight. I heard something outside and got worried. That's when I saw... I thought I saw someone by the dock.;

Detective:Someone? Can you describe them?;
Harper:It was dark. The storm... I couldn't see clearly. Just a silhouette. I called out but no one answered. Then I went to find Rowan.;
Detective:We'll revisit some of these details later, Ms. Lin. For now, that's all.;
Harper:Can I go?;
Detective:Not yet. Stay here.;
