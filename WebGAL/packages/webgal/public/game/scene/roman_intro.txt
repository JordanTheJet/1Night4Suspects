Detective:Mr. Adler, thank you for hosting this evening. I understand this is your property.;
Roman:It is. My family's lake house. I thought bringing everyone together might help... heal old wounds. Clearly, I was wrong.;
Detective:Tell me about the security cameras. They went offline during the incident.;

Detective:Our technician says the system was manually disabled at 10\:03 PM. Before the storm.;

Roman:...I disabled them. For privacy. These are my friends. I didn't want them feeling watched in my home.;
Detective:That's convenient timing.;
Roman:Detective, I have nothing to hide. Check my phone records, my computer, whatever you need. I wanted a peaceful weekend. That's all.;
Detective:What were you doing between 11 PM and 1 AM?;

Roman:Harper came to me around midnight, upset about seeing someone outside. I made her tea. We waited in the living room. When Elias didn't return, we called you.;
Detective:And you didn't go outside to check?;
Roman:In a storm? With a potentially dangerous situation? No. I'm not a hero, Detective. I'm a banker.;
Detective:We'll be in touch, Mr. Adler.;
Roman:I'll be here. I want this resolved as much as you do.;

Roman is cooperating, but something feels rehearsed.;
