Marcus:Do I have a choice? Look, I already told your officers everything I know.;
Detective:Tell me again. When did you last see Elias?;
Marcus:Dinner. Around 9, maybe 9\:30. Things got heated, I left the table. Went to my room.;
Detective:What were you and Elias arguing about?;

Marcus:You want the short version or the therapy session? He stole my company. StreamMetrics. | We built it together, and he sold it without telling me. Two point three million dollars. | I got two hundred thousand after lawyers. You do the math.;
Detective:That must have been difficult.;

Marcus:Difficult? It destroyed my life. But that was three years ago. I came this weekend because... I don't know. Roman said Elias wanted to apologize or something. Fat lot of good that did.;
Detective:You said you went to your room after the argument. Did you stay there?;
Marcus:...Yes. I was tired. Emotionally drained. I just wanted to sleep and get out of there in the morning.;
Detective:We found boot prints at the overlook. Size 11. Your size.;
changeFigure:marcus_defensive.png -next;
Marcus:So what? I went for a walk earlier in the evening, before dinner. Is that a crime?;
Detective:The prints are fresh. From last night. After the rain started.;
Marcus:I... look, I don't remember every step I took. Maybe I went out for air. I don't know.;
Detective:Mr. Hale, I need you to be straight with me. Were you at that overlook last night?;
Marcus:I want a lawyer.;
Detective:That's your right. We'll continue this later.;
